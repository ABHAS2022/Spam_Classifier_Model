## Introduction

Spam messages, also known as unsolicited or unwanted messages, are a common issue in communication. This project aims to automatically detect and classify messages as either spam or ham. It can be used in email clients, messaging apps, or any system where message classification is required.

## Features

- Machine learning-based spam classification.
- Customizable and extendable for different datasets.
- Easy-to-use Python library for integration with other applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spam_Classifier_Model.git


## Training the Model
The project includes a training dataset from [Kaggle][https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset] to train the classification model. 

### Evaluation
We can evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Details are provided in the evaluation script.
